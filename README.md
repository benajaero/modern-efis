# Electric Flight System (EFS)

The Electric Flight System (EFS) is a forward-thinking project aimed at innovating the management of electric aircraft operations through a web-based interface. Built with the Next.js framework, this system offers performance and scalability for real-time data monitoring.

## Introduction

EFS is designed to provide a streamlined user experience for those involved in the electric aviation industry. Although currently not featuring flight planning, the system lays the groundwork for integrating comprehensive management capabilities in the future.
